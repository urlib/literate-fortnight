HOWTO install uGet manually.

  The environment variable "PATH" must include GTK+ 3.4 or above runtime library path.
For Example, if you install GTK+ 3.4 runtime library in "C:\GTK3", you must add
"C:\GTK3\bin" or "C:\GTK3\lib" to PATH.

  You can also edit uget-path.reg and double click it to setup program location and path.
