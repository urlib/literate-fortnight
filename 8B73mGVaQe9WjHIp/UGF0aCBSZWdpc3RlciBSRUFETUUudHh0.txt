uGet Auto-register require Mono/.Net 2.0 or later to run.

The file named "Path Register.exe" should be placed anywhere in uGet directory (No matter it's "bin" or "config" or "etc" or their parent directory !)
But the other one ("Path Remove.exe") works fine everywhere.
Due to their nature they should be run as Administrator to do their job,?? Else user will see a message requesting him/her to run them as Administrator.
